# Smart Contract Security Analysis with LLMs

This repository aims to provide examples of using LLMs for Solidity smart contract security analysis using various prompt engineering methods.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure API credentials in `config/config.yaml`.
4. Run `main.py` to test different prompt engineering strategies.

## Prompt Engineering Techniques
- **Zero-Shot**: Basic vulnerability detection.
- **Few-Shot**: Uses examples to improve accuracy.
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Step-by-step reasoning.
- **Instruction-Based**: Structured output format for auditing reports.
